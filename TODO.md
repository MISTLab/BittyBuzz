- Currently, stigmergies can only have a string as key. The reason for that
is that we thought we didn't have enough space in a message's payload to also
specify the type of the key. However, since we prohibit sending tables and
closures (which require two extra metadata bits), we could use one byte
which contains the type of both the key and the value, and 4B (2*2B) for the
objects' values. Thus, the `bbzmsg_vstig_t` structure would look as such:
  ```C
  bbzmsg_payload_type_t type;
  bbzrobot_id_t rid;
  uint8_t lamport;
  uint8_t types; /**< @brief bits 6-4: type of 'key', bits 3-0: type of 'data' */
  uintptr_t key;
  uintptr_t data;
  ```
- We create kilobot-specific C closures `src/kilobot/behaviors`. Most of
these are generic functions of kilobots should be available out-of-the box.
Thus, it would be good if these closures were registered from the
bbzkilobot library instead of the C implementations. That also means that
the names of the closures registered from the kilobot side should be
concatenated to user's BST file. That's a small change that would make
creating a new behavior less daunting. Ideally, users should be able to
simply write a Buzz script and have it generated into a hex file.
- Allow a user to choose what configuration values to use for each C script.
Not sure how to implement this exactly.
- Some `bbz<type>_new` and `bbz<type>_get` functions were implemented
recently. It would be good to change BittyBuzz so that we use those. For
example, `bzbheap_idx_t foo = bbzint_new(value)` is better than
`bbzvm_pushi(value); bbzheap_idx_t foo = bbzvm_stack_at(0); bbzvm_pop();`
because it's faster to run, doesn't use the stack and BittyBuzz will take
less Flash space.
- Implement a BittyBuzz kilobot controller for ARGoS so that users can
simulate their behaviors on it. (_NOTE:_ BittyBuzz expects the existance of
exactly one VM. For kilobots, this doesn't matter because the kilobot
extension or ARGoS uses separate processes, but if someone implements a
controller for a robot for which this is not the case, the controller
developper can merely 'swap' VM pointer when changing which robot we are
controlling, or something like that). For debugging, you can use `simulavr`
along with the remote target feature of `avr-gdb`.
- Redo the heap tests so that they use our testing macro (REQUIRE, ASSERT,
ASSERT_EQUAL). Currently, the test will look like it passes even if it
doesn't.
- Look for TODO and FIXME everywhere inside the repository for smaller
things that could be improved.
